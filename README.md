## AI Project Outline
We will employ three distinct algorithms to assist us in determining whether fetal health is normal, suspect, or pathological. The data utilized originates from Kaggle and comprises observations extracted from cardiotocogram exams (CTGs). Leveraging a dataset consisting of 2126 rows, our objective is to interpret the available features—including fetal heart rate (FHR), fetal movements, and uterine contractions—to classify fetal health into one of the three expert categories identified by obstetricians.

The selected algorithms for this task are unsupervised k-NN (k-Nearest Neighbors), Feedforward Neural Network, and, finally, a combination of random forest and decision tree approaches. These algorithms were chosen due to their intriguing nature and our desire to compare their performances. Moreover, we deliberately opted for unsupervised k-NN given that the other algorithms operate under supervised learning, to discern the distinctions in their operational dynamics.
